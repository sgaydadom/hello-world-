          <p>The "Magicians" by Lev Grossman has a startling amount of characters, all with depth and interests that are not dependent on each other. The ones I like to focus on the most, are Quentin "Q" Coldwater (The main protagonist), Margo "Bambi" Hanson, and Elliot Waugh.</p>

              <blockquote> "<em>My friend Julia said that I couldn't run away hard enough. She's right. I run and I find secret doors - whether I'm alone or in a group, it doesn't matter. Like I'm here. I'm in this amazing place. I have literal magic in my life and I'm still running. I'm still this person that I fucking hate.</em>"</blockquote>

          <p>When we first meet Q, he's a self described "depressed supernerd", introverted and lost in a world that he has never quite been able to interact with. He is more at home in the fictional world of Fillory-a combination of Narnia and Harry Potter-than going to bars or parties and spending time with people his age. With his childhood friend (and previous crush) Julia as his only real connection with the world, Q skates around the edges of society, desperately trying to find meaning, and the answers to his own mind.</p>

          <p>Cue Magic. Following a seemingly magic card through the alleys of New York, Q stumbles upon the campus of Brakebills University, a graduate school for people with latent magical abilities. Elated that all his dreams seem to have come true, that the fictional worlds and talents that he'd thought inaccessible, are suddenly within his reach, Q sets out to learn magic, and hopefully figure out why the supposedly fictional character of Jane Chatwin-a main character in the Fillory series-keeps appearing and telling him to venture off the garden path. Throughout the show, Q makes friends in the form of Alice Quinn-legacy student with a secret motivation to her Brakebills acceptance, Elliot Waugh, senior and "Party King" of campus and leader of the Physical Kids cottage; Margo Hanson, Elliot's best friend and an ambitious woman who knows her own self-worth; and the recurrence of Julia. He makes allies in the form of Hedgewitch Kady Orloff-Diaz, Psychic and Traveler (teleporter) Penny Adiyodi, and friendly Nature student and drug dealer extrodinaire, Josh Hoberman.</p>

              <blockquote> "<em>Becoming me, was the greatest creative project of my life.</em>"</blockquote>

          <p>Elliot Waugh is a brilliant, chaotic, telekinetic, self-confident, dandy. Despite his seemingly polished and perfect demeanor, hidden beneath his satin vests and snarky humor Elliot is hiding an immense amount of pain. Having grown up in an atmosphere that stomped out anything different, abused and discarded the weak, Elliot made it his mission in life to build himself into a completely different person than he was before Brakebills. While aloof in general, Elliot does have an incredibly close and mildly co-dependent relationship with his platonic soulmate, Margo. Margo is the only person who knows all of Elliot's secrets and history, and has helped and supported him in his attempts to remake himself into his ideal image. While generous with his physical affection and humor, Elliot tends to be rather aloof or unreachable to the majority of students. As Q's designated guide to the Brakebills Entrance Exam, Elliot was the first magician to meet Q and impart his sarcastic humor onto the vulnerable and confused new student. Suprisingly loyal despite his seemingly careless veneer, Elliot adopts Q into the fold of his and Margo's world, allowing the other friends and allies to revolve around them like socially awkward and sometimes violent moons. Throughout the series we see Elliot grow as a person, develop more empathy and learn how to handle responsibilities on a truly ridiculous scale.

            <blockquote> "<em>Don't accuse me of catching feelings, alright? It's insulting.</em>"</blockquote>

        <p>Margo Hanson is a talented, beautiful, ambitious, flirt. She hides her gentle side (small though it is) underneath spikes made from the ice she commands so well, stylish dresses, and cold logic that Spock would be jealous of. She tells Quentin that she had in fact read the "Fillory and Further" series, but that no one can know about her secret nerd past. This being said, she has a staggering intellect and memory, often remembering spells, mythology, folklore and circumstances that often saves the day. While her relationship with Elliot is very flirty and devoted, it is clear that she doesn't see Elliot as a potential romantic partner, but her platonic soulmate and the only person in life who she can stand, as well as understand her. Elliot's partner during the "Secrets Trial", Margo is the only one to know Elliot's past until he eventually reveals it to his boyfriend Mike(that's a whole other monster topic that I'll go into later). Often seen as selfish or reckless, Margo reserves her support and affection for those she deems truly matter. Generally, this means Elliot, although she does later adopt a more friendly and affectionate relationship with Q. Elliot is her other half, and while she's never afraid to call him out on his bullshit, she is also his biggest and strongest supporter, ready to fight tooth and nail to protect him in any way necessary. Throughout the series, we see Margo really come into her own, thriving on the trust, responsibilities, and authority (provided by the not-so-fictional land of Fillory) that Elliot tends to run from. A brilliant magician and master strategist, Margo doesn't shy away from doing what needs to be done, and has honed herself into the sharpest and coldest blade possible.</p>
